# Dynamic-Personal-Website

A multi-page website project featuring a custom HTML structure, modern CSS design, and front-end interactivity driven by JavaScript. The site includes multiple pages (Home, About, Contact, Project) and uses custom image assets for a unique visual theme.

## üöÄ Features

* **Multi-Page Structure:** The core content is split across multiple HTML files (`1.html` is likely the main/home page, with the image assets (`home.jpg`, `about.jpg`, etc.) suggesting separate pages or sections for each.
* **Custom Styling (1.css):** Defines the visual layout, color scheme, and responsive design for the entire site.
* **Front-end Interactivity (1.js):** Contains custom JavaScript logic for page elements, animations, or user interactions.
* **Visual Assets:** Uses several image files for background, sections, or branding, indicating a visually rich design. The presence of a PSD file (`track.psd`) and a design asset (`balldesign.png`) suggests a sporty, track-related, or abstract theme.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Structure

The files should be organized to allow for proper linking between HTML, CSS, and image assets.

| File Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `1.html` | The main HTML file (likely the home page or a primary template). |
| `1.css` | The main CSS stylesheet for the entire website's design and layout. |
| `1.js` | The main JavaScript file handling client-side interactions and logic. |
| `home.jpg`, `about.jpg`, `contact.jpg`, `project.jpg` | Image assets likely used as background or hero images for the corresponding pages/sections. |
| `9.jpg` | An additional visual asset. |
| `balldesign.png` | A graphic asset, possibly a logo or design element, suggesting a sports or movement theme. |
| `track.psd` | A Photoshop document containing source material or layered design elements for a 'track' component of the site (e.g., a background or animation path). |
